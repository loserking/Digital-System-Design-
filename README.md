# Digital-System-Design
Firstly, we will introduce the Hardware Description
Language (HDL). The chosen HDL is Verilog. We will formally cover
  The HDL grammar (basics)
  The coding guideline (how to write elegant codes)
  The synthesis guideline (how to write feasible/implementable codes)
  Modern cell-based synthesis flow (how to link with modern EDA tools & ASIC design flow)
  Reuse Manual Methodology (RMM) – How to create “reusable” codes for IP (Intellectual property) reuse
Secondly, we will ask students to design an advanced MIPS CPU. It is based on the knowledge of “Computer Architecture.” The assignment covers Instruction development and implementations in RTL(register-transfer level) HDL coding and simulation of major blocks such as Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) and Control Unit (CU).
Enhanced RISC-based CPU design with Pipelining, Forwarding, and Hazard Control
Integration of whole design by feeding MIPS with assembly codes (programs).Design a pipelined RISC CPU which is capable of
  Generating Fibonacci series（費氏數列）
  Executing efficient Sorting algorithms
Compete with all teams in terms of Gate count and Execution Speed (Area x Timing performance index)
